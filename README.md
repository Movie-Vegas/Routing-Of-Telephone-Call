The Goal

A program that can handle any number of price lists (operators) and then can calculate which operator that is cheapest for a certain number. You can assume that each price list can have thousands of entries but they will all fit together in memory.

Telephone numbers should be inputted in the same format as in price lists, for example “68123456789”. The challenge is to find the cheapest operator for that number.
